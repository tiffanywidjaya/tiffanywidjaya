## Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme

Hi there! üëãüèª

In the hushed halls of existence, where whispers of potential reverberate, I find myself traversing the labyrinth of curiosity, in search of strands of sagacity interwoven into the rich tapestry of experience. As a result, here I am! I'm Tiffany and is currently a fan of ~~Choi Youngjae~~ Machine Learning and UI/UX is my passion, as designing has been my habit since high school.

In the silent corridors of creation, where echoes of design possibility resonate, I have woven my craft into the fabric of various school projects, albeit without the thorough documentation that hindsight often craves. From those initial forays into design, where I crafted posters and illustrations for requests that whispered through the academic halls, my journey has now led me to the embrace of Informatics.

As I tread the path of Informatics study, I've uncovered a bridge that allows me to traverse the realms of design‚Äîthe captivating world of UI/UX. Here, I embark on a quest to meld the aesthetics of the digital realm with the seamless functionality that lies at the heart of user experience.

Moreover, in this chapter of my creative odyssey, I contemplate the prospect of extending my services beyond the confines of academia. A vision takes root‚Äîa service, a beacon where design aspirations converge, offering a tapestry of creative solutions. It is a journey where pixels meet purpose, and where the artistry of design unfolds in the fluid dance of code and user interaction.
