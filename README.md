## Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme

Hi there! 👋🏻

In the hushed halls of existence, where whispers of potential reverberate, I find myself traversing the labyrinth of curiosity, in search of strands of sagacity interwoven into the rich tapestry of experience. As a result, here I am! I'm Tiffany and is currently a fan of UI/UX, as designing has been my habit since high school.
